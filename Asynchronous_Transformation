Synchronous transformations are those components which process each row and push down to the next component/destination, 
it uses allocated buffer memory and doesnâ€™t require additional memory as it is direct relation between input/output 
data row which fits completely into allocated memory. Components like Lookup, Derived Columns, and Data Conversion etc. 
fall into this category.

Asynchronous transformations are those components which first store data into buffer memory then process operations 
like Sort and Aggregate. Additional buffer memory is required to complete the task and until the buffer memory is available 
it holds up the entire data in memory and blocks the transaction, also known as blocking transformation. 
To complete the task SSIS engine (data flow pipeline engine) will allocate extra buffer memory, 
which is again an overhead to the ETL system. Components like Sort, Aggregate, Merge, Join, etc. fall into this category.
