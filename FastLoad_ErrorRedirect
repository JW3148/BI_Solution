if fast load, then the data is load by batch(rather then row by row)

fast load = batch load

the problem with redirect error record in batch load is that
the whole batch will be redirect if it contains an error row.

solution:

FAST OLEDB destination --> (redirect error) --> 
ROW BY ROW OLEDB same destinatoin --> (redirect error) --> 
error destination
